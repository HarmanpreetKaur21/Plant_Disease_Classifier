# Plant Disease Classifier

## 🌱 Overview
The **Plant Disease Classifier** is a deep learning-based project that identifies plant diseases from leaf images. It helps farmers and agricultural experts diagnose issues early and take preventive measures to improve crop health. Additionally, it integrates an **LLM (Large Language Model)** that not only predicts the disease but also provides solutions and treatment recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image-based Classification**: Detects diseases using deep learning models.
- **Multiple Disease Support**: Classifies various plant diseases with high accuracy.
- **Solution Recommendations**: Provides treatments and preventive measures using an integrated LLM.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Runs seamlessly using Streamlit.
- **Efficient & Fast**: Provides real-time predictions and solutions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow **
- **OpenCV**
- **Streamlit** (for UI deployment)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation)
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** (for generating disease solutions)

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarmanpreetKaur21/Plant_Disease_Classifier.git
   cd Plant_Disease_Classifier
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf through the UI.
3. The system will return the predicted disease along with recommended treatments and solutions generated by the integrated LLM.


## 🖼️ Example Input/Output
**Input:** Image of a plant leaf  
**Output:** Predicted disease name, confidence score, and recommended treatment
